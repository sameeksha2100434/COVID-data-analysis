# COVID-19 Data Analysis using Python
### CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC DATA ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION MODELING USING DATA MINING TECHNIQUES: 
## Tech used : Python, Matplotlib , tkinter library 
- Implemented a comprehensive data mining and analytics project centered on COVID-19 pandemic, Demonstrating the efficiency of the model in forecasting pandemic trends to construct predictive models and also developed an intuitive user interface. <br>
* Yielding impressive accuracy rates: 90% for less than 200 cases, 82% for 200-1000 cases, and 87% for cases exceeding 1000.

#  Introduction
COVID-19 is the disease caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.  WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of so-called viral pneumonia in Wuhan, Peopleâ€™s Republic of China.


## Created a complete COVID-19 report using Python and its powerful data science packages.

I am going to walk you through the steps I undertook for this analysis with visuals and code snippets.

#### Steps involved in Data Analysis:
1. Imported required packages

2. Gathering Data

3. Transforming Data to our needs (Data Wrangling)

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization

# What should I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms?
- If you are unwell, stay at home.

* If you have any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, wear a mask when interacting with others in or outside of your household or sharing space with others. If you have shortness of breath or pain or pressure in the chest, seek medical attention at a health facility immediately. Call your health care provider or hotline in advance for direction to the right health facility.

+ Get tested for COVID-19, regardless of your vaccination status, and especially if you are at high-risk for severe illness and could therefore be eligible for drug treatments.

- Practice protective and preventive measures. Wear a mask, avoid crowded and poorly ventilated areas, improve ventilation in indoor spaces, keep a distance, practice hand hygiene, and respiratory etiquette (covering your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze), get vaccinated and stay up to date with booster doses.

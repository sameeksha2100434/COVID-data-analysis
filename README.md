### 📊 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive data mining and analytics approach focused on the COVID-19 pandemic. It showcases the efficiency of forecasting models in predicting pandemic trends and features an intuitive user interface for user interaction.
- **Datasets Used:** 2 real life data-sets in the format of CSV files, called : covid_19_data.csv and covid19_line_list_data_modified.


### 🎯 Key Achievements
- **Forecasting Accuracy:**
  - 🎯 90% accuracy for cases under 200
  - 📈 82% accuracy for cases between 200 and 1000
  - 📉 87% accuracy for cases exceeding 1000

### 📖 Introduction
COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which was first reported by the WHO on December 31, 2019, after a cluster of viral pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China.

### 🔍 Data Analysis Steps:
1. **Importing Required Packages:** Utilizing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
2. **Data Gathering:** Collecting data from reliable sources (e.g., WHO, CDC).
3. **Data Transformation:** Cleaning and transforming data to meet analysis needs (Data Wrangling).
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing trends and visualizing data to derive insights.

### 💻 Technology Stack:
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib
- **User Interface:** Tkinter Library

COVID-19 is the disease caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.  WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of so-called viral pneumonia in Wuhan, Peopleâ€™s Republic of China.
# What should I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms?
--> If you are unwell, stay at home.

--> If you have any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, wear a mask when interacting with others in or outside of your household or sharing space with others. If you have shortness of breath or pain or pressure in the chest, seek medical attention at a health facility immediately. Call your health care provider or hotline in advance for direction to the right health facility.

--> Get tested for COVID-19, regardless of your vaccination status, and especially if you are at high-risk for severe illness and could therefore be eligible for drug treatments.

--> Practice protective and preventive measures. Wear a mask, avoid crowded and poorly ventilated areas, improve ventilation in indoor spaces, keep a distance, practice hand hygiene, and respiratory etiquette (covering your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze), get vaccinated and stay up to date with booster doses.
